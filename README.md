# Predicting song popularity based on Spotify data 
This here contains a code written as part of the course Data Mining by Dr. Chen Hajaj at Ariel University.

The dataset chosen for this project contains tracks that were released from 1920 to 2021. 

It contains several interesting metrices defined by Spotify for each track. These vary from acousticness to danceability, major/minor and explicity. 

The code includes EDA performed on the dataset showing different trends, as well ad pre-proccessing and ML models for prediction.
